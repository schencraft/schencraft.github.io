Hello and welcome!

I'm Simon Chen, and this is my personal space on the internet where I share thoughts on design, technology, and the creative journey.

## Why This Blog?

Over the years, I've accumulated knowledge and experiences that I believe could be valuable to others. This blog is my way of giving back to the community that has taught me so much.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Design Insights** - Explorations in UI/UX, visual design principles, and creative problem-solving
- **Tech Tutorials** - Practical guides on web development, tools, and workflows
- **Project Stories** - Behind-the-scenes looks at what I'm building and learning

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to meet fellow creators and technologists. Feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/schencraft).

Stay tuned for more content coming soon.
