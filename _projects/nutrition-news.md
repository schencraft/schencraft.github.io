### Eating Vitamin C Can Physically Change Your Skin

A University of Otago study published in the *Journal of Investigative Dermatology* found that dietary vitamin C travels through the bloodstream directly into skin layers, producing measurable structural changes.

In a trial of 24 healthy adults, those who ate two SunGold kiwifruit daily for eight weeks (~250mg vitamin C) showed:
- **Increased skin thickness** — indicating heightened collagen production
- **Enhanced epidermal cell renewal**
- Strong correlation between blood and skin vitamin C levels

Importantly, dietary vitamin C proved more effective than topical creams. As lead researcher Professor Margreet Vissers noted, vitamin C "does not absorb well through the outer skin barrier" when applied topically, but skin cells efficiently absorb it from the bloodstream.

**Key takeaway:** For skin health benefits, eat your vitamin C rather than just applying it. Aim for ~250mg daily from fresh fruits and vegetables like citrus, berries, kiwi, and broccoli.

**中文摘要：** 奥塔哥大学发表在《皮肤病学研究杂志》上的一项研究发现，膳食中的维生素C通过血液直接进入皮肤层，产生可测量的结构变化。在24名健康成年人的试验中，每天吃两个奇异果（约250毫克维生素C）持续八周的人显示出皮肤厚度增加（表明胶原蛋白生成增加）和表皮细胞更新增强。重要的是，膳食维生素C比外用护肤品更有效，因为皮肤从外部吸收维生素C的效果很差，但能有效地从血液中吸收。

**关键要点：** 为了皮肤健康，应该通过饮食摄入维生素C，而不仅仅是外用。建议每天从柑橘、浆果、奇异果和西兰花等新鲜水果蔬菜中摄入约250毫克。

### Not All Plant-Based Diets Are Equal for Heart Health

A major French study tracking 63,835 adults for an average of 9 years found that the cardiovascular benefits of plant-based eating depend heavily on food quality and processing level.

**Key findings:**
- High-quality, **minimally processed** plant foods → ~40% **lower** cardiovascular risk
- **Ultra-processed** plant foods (chips, sugary cereals, sweetened drinks) → ~40% **higher** risk
- Nutritionally superior but ultra-processed plant items showed **no benefit** compared to animal-based foods

The researchers from INRAE, Inserm, and Université Sorbonne Paris Nord emphasized that understanding diet and heart health "requires considering the nutritional quality of foods and how heavily they are processed" — not just whether foods are plant or animal-based.

**Key takeaway:** Going plant-based? Focus on whole foods like beans, lentils, nuts, and whole grains — not processed veggie burgers, chips, and sugary plant-based alternatives.

---

**中文摘要：** 一项追踪63,835名成年人平均9年的法国大型研究发现，植物性饮食的心血管益处在很大程度上取决于食物质量和加工程度。高质量、低加工的植物性食物可降低约40%的心血管风险；而超加工植物性食物（薯片、含糖谷物、甜饮料）则风险增加约40%。营养价值较高但超加工的植物性食品与动物性食品相比没有任何益处。

**关键要点：** 选择植物性饮食？请专注于豆类、扁豆、坚果和全谷物等天然食物——而非加工的素食汉堡、薯片和含糖的植物性替代品。

### Coffee Compounds May Help Control Blood Sugar

Roasted coffee may do more than provide a morning boost — researchers have discovered new compounds in coffee that inhibit α-glucosidase, a key enzyme involved in carbohydrate digestion and blood sugar regulation.

Some of these newly identified coffee molecules were even more potent than previously known α-glucosidase inhibitors. This enzyme is a target for type 2 diabetes medications, as slowing its activity helps prevent blood sugar spikes after meals.

**Key takeaway:** This is early research, but it adds to evidence that moderate coffee consumption may have metabolic benefits. Note that adding sugar and cream would likely counteract any blood sugar benefits.

---

**中文摘要：** 烘焙咖啡可能不仅仅提供早晨的提神效果——研究人员发现了咖啡中能抑制α-葡萄糖苷酶的新化合物，这是一种参与碳水化合物消化和血糖调节的关键酶。一些新发现的咖啡分子甚至比已知的α-葡萄糖苷酶抑制剂更有效。这种酶是2型糖尿病药物的靶点，因为减缓其活性有助于防止餐后血糖飙升。

**关键要点：** 这是早期研究，但增加了适量饮用咖啡可能具有代谢益处的证据。请注意，添加糖和奶油可能会抵消任何血糖益处。

### Food Preservatives Linked to Higher Diabetes Risk

A large study spanning more than a decade has found a concerning association between preservative additives and metabolic health.

People with the **highest intake of preservative additives** were significantly more likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared to those with lower intake. The findings suggest that chemicals used to extend shelf life may have unintended metabolic consequences.

This aligns with broader research showing that ultra-processed foods — which typically contain more preservatives — are associated with various health risks beyond just their nutritional profile.

**Key takeaway:** Another reason to prioritize fresh, whole foods over packaged products with long ingredient lists. When buying packaged foods, shorter ingredient lists are generally better.

### Harvard Experts Raise Concerns About New Dietary Guidelines

Three Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health faculty members who served on the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee have raised concerns about the final 2025-2030 guidelines.

Key criticisms include:
- **Animal protein emphasis**: Guidelines prioritize meat over plant-based proteins, despite most Americans already getting adequate protein
- **Dairy inconsistency**: The three-serving daily recommendation for full-fat dairy conflicts with the guidelines' own saturated fat limits
- **Missing vegetable oils**: Despite being primary sources of healthy unsaturated fats, vegetable oils are notably absent
- **Transparency issues**: Lack of clarity about who wrote the final guidelines and what methodology was used

**Key takeaway:** Consider using Harvard's [Healthy Eating Plate](https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-eating-plate/) as an evidence-based alternative guide, and consult a registered dietitian for personalized advice.

### Half of Americans Plan New Diet for 2026

A survey of 2,201 U.S. adults by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found that nearly half plan to start a new diet this year.

**Popular approaches:**
- 42% plan to reduce calorie intake
- 28% will try low-carb diets (keto, Atkins, South Beach)
- Only 6% plan to try plant-based or vegan diets

**The cost paradox:** Over 80% cited grocery costs as important when choosing a diet, yet most overlook plant-based options. Research shows plant-based diets can reduce food costs by ~$1.80/day compared to typical American diets, and a 2018 study found participants lost an average of 14.3 pounds over 16 weeks on a plant-based diet.

**Key takeaway:** If cost is a concern, don't overlook plant-based eating—beans, lentils, and whole grains are among the most affordable protein sources available.

### Full-Fat Cheese Linked to Lower Dementia Risk

A large study tracking participants for more than 25 years found that eating full-fat cheese and cream may be associated with a lower risk of dementia.

This adds to growing evidence that dairy fat may not be as harmful as once thought—though researchers caution this is observational data, not proof of cause and effect.

**Key takeaway:** Enjoying cheese in moderation as part of a balanced diet appears to be fine for most people. The key word remains "moderation"—this isn't a license to overindulge.

---

**中文摘要：** 一项追踪参与者超过25年的大型研究发现，食用全脂奶酪和奶油可能与较低的痴呆风险有关。这增加了越来越多的证据，表明乳脂肪可能不像曾经认为的那样有害——尽管研究人员提醒这是观察性数据，而非因果关系的证明。

**关键要点：** 作为均衡饮食的一部分，适量享用奶酪对大多数人来说似乎是可以的。关键词仍然是"适量"——这不是过度放纵的许可。

### New U.S. Dietary Guidelines Spark Debate

The USDA and HHS released the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2025-2030 on January 7th, marking what officials call "the most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in decades."

The key message: **eat real food**. The guidelines emphasize:
- High-quality protein at every meal (both animal and plant sources)
- Full-fat dairy is no longer discouraged
- First-ever warning about highly processed foods
- Lower-carb diets may benefit those with chronic conditions

However, the guidelines have drawn criticism. Researchers noted that the advisory panel included members with [financial ties to beef and dairy industries](https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/07/new-dietary-guidelines-review-panel-financial-ties-beef-dairy-industry/), and the guidelines stop short of specific recommendations on ultra-processed foods or alcohol.

**Key takeaway:** The emphasis on whole, unprocessed foods is solid advice regardless of the controversy. Focus on real food over packaged products.

---

**中文摘要：** 美国农业部和卫生与公众服务部于1月7日发布了《2025-2030年美国膳食指南》，官员称这是"数十年来联邦营养政策最重大的调整"。核心信息是：**吃真正的食物**。指南强调每餐摄入优质蛋白质、不再反对全脂乳制品、首次警告高度加工食品的危害，以及低碳水化合物饮食可能有益于慢性病患者。然而，该指南也引发争议，因为顾问委员会成员与牛肉和乳制品行业存在经济利益关系。

**关键要点：** 无论争议如何，强调天然、未加工食品是可靠的建议。选择真正的食物，而非包装加工食品。

### Scientists Discover Safer Way to Boost Metabolism

Researchers at the University of Technology Sydney have developed experimental compounds that make cells burn more calories by subtly tweaking how mitochondria produce energy.

This is significant because older versions of these chemicals (mitochondrial uncouplers) were once used for weight loss but were banned for being deadly. The new compounds appear to be much safer.

Beyond weight management, these mild uncouplers also appear to:
- Lower oxidative stress within cells
- Support healthier metabolism
- Potentially slow aging-related processes
- Help protect against neurodegenerative conditions like dementia

**Key takeaway:** While this is still experimental, it represents a promising direction for metabolic research. No supplements available yet—this is early-stage science.

---

**中文摘要：** 悉尼科技大学的研究人员开发出一种实验性化合物，通过微调线粒体产生能量的方式，使细胞燃烧更多卡路里。这项研究意义重大，因为此类化学物质的早期版本曾用于减肥，但因致命性而被禁用。新化合物似乎安全得多。除了体重管理，这些温和的解偶联剂还能降低细胞内的氧化应激、支持更健康的代谢、可能延缓衰老过程，并有助于预防痴呆等神经退行性疾病。

**关键要点：** 虽然这仍处于实验阶段，但代表了代谢研究的一个有前景的方向。目前尚无相关补充剂——这是早期科学研究。

### Intermittent Fasting: Is Timing Really Everything?

A new study from the German Institute of Human Nutrition is raising questions about intermittent fasting's metabolic benefits.

Researchers put 31 women who were overweight or obese on two different intermittent fasting schedules and found that neither approach altered markers of metabolic or cardiovascular health.

The implication? It may be **calorie reduction rather than time-restricted eating** itself that produces health benefits.

**Key takeaway:** If intermittent fasting helps you eat less overall and fits your lifestyle, it can still be a useful tool. But don't expect magic from the timing alone—total intake still matters most.

---

**中文摘要：** 德国人类营养研究所的一项新研究对间歇性禁食的代谢益处提出质疑。研究人员让31名超重或肥胖女性采用两种不同的间歇性禁食方案，结果发现两种方法都没有改变代谢或心血管健康指标。这意味着产生健康益处的可能是**卡路里减少，而非限时进食**本身。

**关键要点：** 如果间歇性禁食能帮助你减少总体摄入量并适合你的生活方式，它仍然是一个有用的工具。但不要期望仅靠进食时间就能产生神奇效果——总摄入量仍然最重要。

### Omega-3 and Vitamin D May Slow Biological Aging

Two studies offer encouraging news for those focused on longevity:

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** The European DO-HEALTH trial, published in Nature Aging, found that taking 1,000mg of combined DHA and EPA daily may slow biological aging over three years in adults over 70.

**Vitamin D:** The VITAL Telomere Study suggests that 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily for four years significantly reduced telomere shrinkage—equivalent to preventing about three years of aging.

**Key takeaway:** These supplements show promise for healthy aging, particularly for older adults. Consult your doctor about appropriate dosing for your situation.

---

**中文摘要：** 两项研究为关注长寿的人带来了令人鼓舞的消息。**Omega-3脂肪酸：** 发表在《自然·衰老》上的欧洲DO-HEALTH试验发现，每天服用1000毫克DHA和EPA组合可能在三年内减缓70岁以上成年人的生物衰老。**维生素D：** VITAL端粒研究表明，每天服用2000国际单位维生素D持续四年，可显著减少端粒缩短——相当于延缓约三年的衰老。

**关键要点：** 这些补充剂对健康老龄化显示出前景，尤其是对老年人。请咨询医生了解适合您情况的剂量。

### GLP-1 Medications Expanding Beyond Weight Loss

According to a U.S. News & World Report survey of 58 health experts, GLP-1 medications (like Wegovy and Ozempic) are the top health trend for 2026—but not just for weight loss.

52% of experts predict these medications will increasingly be used for:
- Heart health
- Kidney disease
- Addiction treatment

The FDA also recently approved the first oral GLP-1 for weight loss (Wegovy pill), making these medications more accessible.

**Key takeaway:** GLP-1s are becoming a broader therapeutic tool. If you're considering them, discuss the full range of potential benefits with your healthcare provider.

---

**中文摘要：** 根据《美国新闻与世界报道》对58位健康专家的调查，GLP-1药物（如Wegovy和Ozempic）是2026年的首要健康趋势——但不仅限于减肥。52%的专家预测这些药物将越来越多地用于心脏健康、肾脏疾病和成瘾治疗。FDA最近还批准了首款口服GLP-1减肥药（Wegovy药片），使这些药物更容易获得。

**关键要点：** GLP-1正在成为更广泛的治疗工具。如果您正在考虑使用，请与医疗保健提供者讨论其全部潜在益处。
