<h4>🍊 Vitamin C Changes Skin Structure</h4>
<div class="card-content">
Dietary vitamin C travels through blood directly into skin layers, increasing thickness (more collagen) and enhancing cell renewal. Eating 2 kiwifruit daily (~250mg) for 8 weeks showed measurable improvements. Dietary intake works better than topical creams.
</div>
<div class="card-takeaway"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Eat your vitamin C from fruits & veggies rather than just applying creams.</div>

<h4>🥗 Not All Plant Diets Equal</h4>
<div class="card-content">
Study of 63,835 adults over 9 years: minimally processed plant foods cut heart risk ~40%, but ultra-processed plant foods (chips, sugary cereals) increased risk ~40%. Processing matters as much as plant vs animal.
