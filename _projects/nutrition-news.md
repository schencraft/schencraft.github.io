### Harvard Experts Raise Concerns About New Dietary Guidelines

Three Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health faculty members who served on the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee have raised concerns about the final 2025-2030 guidelines.

Key criticisms include:
- **Animal protein emphasis**: Guidelines prioritize meat over plant-based proteins, despite most Americans already getting adequate protein
- **Dairy inconsistency**: The three-serving daily recommendation for full-fat dairy conflicts with the guidelines' own saturated fat limits
- **Missing vegetable oils**: Despite being primary sources of healthy unsaturated fats, vegetable oils are notably absent
- **Transparency issues**: Lack of clarity about who wrote the final guidelines and what methodology was used

**Key takeaway:** Consider using Harvard's [Healthy Eating Plate](https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-eating-plate/) as an evidence-based alternative guide, and consult a registered dietitian for personalized advice.

### Half of Americans Plan New Diet for 2026

A survey of 2,201 U.S. adults by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found that nearly half plan to start a new diet this year.

**Popular approaches:**
- 42% plan to reduce calorie intake
- 28% will try low-carb diets (keto, Atkins, South Beach)
- Only 6% plan to try plant-based or vegan diets

**The cost paradox:** Over 80% cited grocery costs as important when choosing a diet, yet most overlook plant-based options. Research shows plant-based diets can reduce food costs by ~$1.80/day compared to typical American diets, and a 2018 study found participants lost an average of 14.3 pounds over 16 weeks on a plant-based diet.

**Key takeaway:** If cost is a concern, don't overlook plant-based eating—beans, lentils, and whole grains are among the most affordable protein sources available.

### Full-Fat Cheese Linked to Lower Dementia Risk

A large study tracking participants for more than 25 years found that eating full-fat cheese and cream may be associated with a lower risk of dementia.

This adds to growing evidence that dairy fat may not be as harmful as once thought—though researchers caution this is observational data, not proof of cause and effect.

**Key takeaway:** Enjoying cheese in moderation as part of a balanced diet appears to be fine for most people. The key word remains "moderation"—this isn't a license to overindulge.

### Plant Protein in Midlife Linked to Healthier Aging

A study from Tufts University and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that women who consumed the most plant protein in their 40s and 50s had a **46% greater likelihood of healthy aging** compared to those who ate less.

Plant protein sources include beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.

**Key takeaway:** It's never too early to prioritize plant proteins. Even if you're not vegetarian, adding more legumes and nuts to your diet may pay dividends for healthy aging.

---

**中文摘要：** 塔夫茨大学和哈佛大学陈曾熙公共卫生学院的一项研究发现，在40多岁和50多岁时摄入最多植物蛋白的女性，与摄入较少的女性相比，**健康老龄化的可能性高出46%**。植物蛋白来源包括豆类、扁豆、豆腐、天贝、坚果、种子和全谷物。

**关键要点：** 优先考虑植物蛋白永远不嫌早。即使您不是素食者，在饮食中添加更多豆类和坚果可能对健康老龄化大有裨益。

### New U.S. Dietary Guidelines Spark Debate

The USDA and HHS released the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2025-2030 on January 7th, marking what officials call "the most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in decades."

The key message: **eat real food**. The guidelines emphasize:
- High-quality protein at every meal (both animal and plant sources)
- Full-fat dairy is no longer discouraged
- First-ever warning about highly processed foods
- Lower-carb diets may benefit those with chronic conditions

However, the guidelines have drawn criticism. Researchers noted that the advisory panel included members with [financial ties to beef and dairy industries](https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/07/new-dietary-guidelines-review-panel-financial-ties-beef-dairy-industry/), and the guidelines stop short of specific recommendations on ultra-processed foods or alcohol.

**Key takeaway:** The emphasis on whole, unprocessed foods is solid advice regardless of the controversy. Focus on real food over packaged products.

### Scientists Discover Safer Way to Boost Metabolism

Researchers at the University of Technology Sydney have developed experimental compounds that make cells burn more calories by subtly tweaking how mitochondria produce energy.

This is significant because older versions of these chemicals (mitochondrial uncouplers) were once used for weight loss but were banned for being deadly. The new compounds appear to be much safer.

Beyond weight management, these mild uncouplers also appear to:
- Lower oxidative stress within cells
- Support healthier metabolism
- Potentially slow aging-related processes
- Help protect against neurodegenerative conditions like dementia

**Key takeaway:** While this is still experimental, it represents a promising direction for metabolic research. No supplements available yet—this is early-stage science.

---

**中文摘要：** 悉尼科技大学的研究人员开发出一种实验性化合物，通过微调线粒体产生能量的方式，使细胞燃烧更多卡路里。这项研究意义重大，因为此类化学物质的早期版本曾用于减肥，但因致命性而被禁用。新化合物似乎安全得多。除了体重管理，这些温和的解偶联剂还能降低细胞内的氧化应激、支持更健康的代谢、可能延缓衰老过程，并有助于预防痴呆等神经退行性疾病。

**关键要点：** 虽然这仍处于实验阶段，但代表了代谢研究的一个有前景的方向。目前尚无相关补充剂——这是早期科学研究。

### Intermittent Fasting: Is Timing Really Everything?

A new study from the German Institute of Human Nutrition is raising questions about intermittent fasting's metabolic benefits.

Researchers put 31 women who were overweight or obese on two different intermittent fasting schedules and found that neither approach altered markers of metabolic or cardiovascular health.

The implication? It may be **calorie reduction rather than time-restricted eating** itself that produces health benefits.

**Key takeaway:** If intermittent fasting helps you eat less overall and fits your lifestyle, it can still be a useful tool. But don't expect magic from the timing alone—total intake still matters most.

---

**中文摘要：** 德国人类营养研究所的一项新研究对间歇性禁食的代谢益处提出质疑。研究人员让31名超重或肥胖女性采用两种不同的间歇性禁食方案，结果发现两种方法都没有改变代谢或心血管健康指标。这意味着产生健康益处的可能是**卡路里减少，而非限时进食**本身。

**关键要点：** 如果间歇性禁食能帮助你减少总体摄入量并适合你的生活方式，它仍然是一个有用的工具。但不要期望仅靠进食时间就能产生神奇效果——总摄入量仍然最重要。

### Omega-3 and Vitamin D May Slow Biological Aging

Two studies offer encouraging news for those focused on longevity:

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** The European DO-HEALTH trial, published in Nature Aging, found that taking 1,000mg of combined DHA and EPA daily may slow biological aging over three years in adults over 70.

**Vitamin D:** The VITAL Telomere Study suggests that 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily for four years significantly reduced telomere shrinkage—equivalent to preventing about three years of aging.

**Key takeaway:** These supplements show promise for healthy aging, particularly for older adults. Consult your doctor about appropriate dosing for your situation.

---

**中文摘要：** 两项研究为关注长寿的人带来了令人鼓舞的消息。**Omega-3脂肪酸：** 发表在《自然·衰老》上的欧洲DO-HEALTH试验发现，每天服用1000毫克DHA和EPA组合可能在三年内减缓70岁以上成年人的生物衰老。**维生素D：** VITAL端粒研究表明，每天服用2000国际单位维生素D持续四年，可显著减少端粒缩短——相当于延缓约三年的衰老。

**关键要点：** 这些补充剂对健康老龄化显示出前景，尤其是对老年人。请咨询医生了解适合您情况的剂量。

### GLP-1 Medications Expanding Beyond Weight Loss

According to a U.S. News & World Report survey of 58 health experts, GLP-1 medications (like Wegovy and Ozempic) are the top health trend for 2026—but not just for weight loss.

52% of experts predict these medications will increasingly be used for:
- Heart health
- Kidney disease
- Addiction treatment

The FDA also recently approved the first oral GLP-1 for weight loss (Wegovy pill), making these medications more accessible.

**Key takeaway:** GLP-1s are becoming a broader therapeutic tool. If you're considering them, discuss the full range of potential benefits with your healthcare provider.

---

**中文摘要：** 根据《美国新闻与世界报道》对58位健康专家的调查，GLP-1药物（如Wegovy和Ozempic）是2026年的首要健康趋势——但不仅限于减肥。52%的专家预测这些药物将越来越多地用于心脏健康、肾脏疾病和成瘾治疗。FDA最近还批准了首款口服GLP-1减肥药（Wegovy药片），使这些药物更容易获得。

**关键要点：** GLP-1正在成为更广泛的治疗工具。如果您正在考虑使用，请与医疗保健提供者讨论其全部潜在益处。
